    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <!-- Before you cook Jollof Rice, you must engage the following meal prep means -->
    
        <h3> Steps to take before cooking the jollof Rice</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the tomato stew.It is advisable to prepare tomato stew before hand and keep in the freezer. This is so that whenever you want to cook any jollof rice related dish, it is just a matter of adding it to your cooking. <img src="./images/Cry.jpg" height="100" width="100" alt="cry emoji"></li>
        <li>If you will use whole chicken then wash and cut it into pieces. Cook with the thyme, Knorr cubes and 2 bulbs of onions (chopped). The cooking time depends on the type of chicken. The rooster or cockerel cooks much faster than the hen but the hen is definitely tastier. When done, grill it in an oven. You may also fry it. This is to give it a golden look which is more presentable especially if you have guests for dinner. <img src="./Images/Gele.jpg" height="90" width="100" alt="Headgear emoji"> </li>
        <li>Parboil the rice using the method detailed in parboiling rice for cooking jollof rice. Rinse the parboiled rice and put in a sieve to drain.

            <li>Add the drained parboiled rice, curry powder, salt and pepper to taste. The water level should be the same level of the rice. This is to ensure that all the water dries up by the time the rice is cooked. <img src="./images/Tasty.jpg" height="100" width="100" alt="Tasty emoji"></li>
            <li>Cover the pot and leave to cook on low to medium heat. This way the rice does not burn before the water dries up.</li>
            <li>If you parboiled the rice as described at parboiling rice for cooking jollof rice, the rice should be done by the time the water is dry. Taste to confirm. If not, you will need to add more water and reduce the heat to prevent burning. Keep cooking till done.</li>
